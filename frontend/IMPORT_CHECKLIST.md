## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Dependencies Issues
```bash
# If npm install fails:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install

# If Tailwind isn't working:
npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next --save-dev
```

### Import Path Issues
```bash
# If @ imports don't work:
# Check tsconfig.json has correct baseUrl and paths
# Restart your IDE/editor
# Run: npm run build to verify TypeScript compilation
```

### Styling Issues
```bash
# If styles don't load:
# Verify src/main.tsx imports '@/styles/globals.css'
# Check vite.config.ts has tailwindcss plugin
# Clear browser cache and reload
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# If app loads slowly:
# Check browser developer tools for console errors
# Verify all images load (check network tab)
# Test in incognito mode to rule out extensions
```
